And now the man wanted to pursue his journey, but the giant begged him
to stay a few days longer, until his brother, who had gone to get in a
store of provisions, should return. When the brother came, they asked
him about the golden castle of Stromberg.

"When I have had time to eat a meal and be satisfied, I will look at the
map."

That being done, he went into his room with them, and they looked at his
maps, but could find nothing: then he fetched other old maps, and they
never left off searching until they found the golden castle of
Stromberg, but it was many thousand miles away.

"How shall I ever get there?" said the man.

"I have a couple of hours to spare," said the giant, "and I will set you
on your way, but I shall have to come back and look after the child that
we have in the house with us."
